## Smart Contracts, Blockchain , DApps Audit Reports

Through our **Automated** and **Manual** analysis we provide complete solution to identify and determine vulnerabilities and violations of logic in the smart contract. **QuillAudits** considers the following distinct and crucial facets of the **smart contract** code: Whether the code is secure. Whether the code corresponds to the documentation (including whitepaper). Whether the code meets best practices in efficient use of gas, code readability, etc.

# Summary

**QuillAudits** is a secure smart contract audits platform designed by **QuillHash Technologies**. It is a fully automated platform to verify smart contracts to check for security vulnerabilities through it's superior manual review and automated tools. We conduct both smart contract audits and penetration tests to find potential security vulnerabilities which might harm the platform's integrity.

## Why is Security Audit Necessary?

Not all smart contracts are as **“smart”** as we think they are. Security is a critical issue in the case of smart contracts. Recent hacks of smart contracts escalated the matter. An audit from trustful third party is the most ingenuous way to identify bugs, vulnerabilities and security flaws in smart contracts which might have remained unnoticed at production level and if your smart contract is ready to deploy this will be the last chance to save your project from becoming another victim of crypto hacks because of irreversible nature of smart contracts.

## Some common bugs in smart contracts that got funds worth millions of dollars stolen :

**Reentrancy attack** ( DAO Fiasco )

**Ownership** of the deployed contract (Oyster pearl attack, parity attack)

**Overflow** and **underflow** Conditions ( 2^256+1 = 0, 0-1 = 2^256 )

**External Calls** — Every external contract call is a risk(make sure all the internal work(state condition)is complete before calling external functions)

**Timestamp Dependence**

(If the contract function can tolerate a 15-second drift in time, it is safe to use block.timestamp)

Storage injection vulnerability in **NEO Smart Contracts** (which allows anyone to change the token’s
total supply limit by transferring their own tokens to an unspecified address.)
