1. Introduction
This Audit Report highlights the overall security of Linkchain Smart Contracts. With this report, we have tried to ensure the reliability of their smart contract by complete assessment of their smart contract codebase.

1.1 Auditing Approach and Methodologies applied
Quillhash team has performed thorough testing of the project starting with analysing the code design patterns in which we reviewed the smart contract architecture to ensure it is structured and safe use of third party smart contracts and libraries.

Our team then performed a formal line by line inspection of the Smart Contract in order to find any potential issue like race conditions, transaction-ordering dependence, timestamp dependence, and denial of service attacks.

In the Unit testing Phase we coded/conducted Custom unit tests written for each function in the contract to verify that each function works as expected. In Automated Testing, We tested the Smart Contract with our in-house developed tools to identify vulnerabilities and security flaws.

The code was tested in collaboration of our multiple team members and this included :

Testing the functionality of the Smart Contract to determine proper logic has been followed throughout.
Analyzing the complexity of the code by thorough, manual review of the code, line-by-line.
Deploying the code on testnet using multiple clients to run live tests.
Analysing failure preparations to check how the Smart Contract performs in case of bugs and vulnerabilities.
Checking whether all the libraries used in the code are on the latest version.
Analyzing the security of the on-chain data.
2. Security Level references
Every issue in this report was assigned a severity level from the following:

High severity issues will probably bring problems and should be fixed.

Medium severity issues could potentially bring problems and should eventually be fixed.

Low severity issues are minor details and warnings that can remain unfixed but would be better fixed at some point in the future.

2.1 High severity issues:-
No bounty function is present , but tokens for the same is reserved from ico token i.e BOUNTY_TOKENS = 2000000(declared,unused variable) wastage of tokens. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
Total supply is 700000000 but total distribution of token is 500000000 including
ADVISOR_TOKENS = 7350000 
STRATEGIC_PARTNERS_TOKENS = 10000000 
RESERVE_TOKENS = 109013333 
OPERATIONS_TOKENS = 3150000 
BOUNTY_TOKENS = 2000000 
TEAM_TOKENS = 141820000 
PRESALE_TOKENS = 56666667 
PRIVATESALE_TOKENS = 100000000 
CROWDSALE_TOKENS = 70000000
And there is no variable or function holding rest of the tokens to transfer manually. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.

You have defined hardcap and softcap in terms of dollars in description and you are taking hard cap and softcap in ether in smart contracts.There must be some ether to dollar conversion mechanism by using oraclize or some manual updation using any function. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
You are not multiplying totalSupply and other token pool with 10^18 .As all wallets use last 18 digits as decimals for tokens .You must multiply totalSupply and other tokenPool like . 
totalSupply = 700000000; 
ADVISOR_TOKENS = 7350000 
STRATEGIC_PARTNERS_TOKENS = 10000000 
RESERVE_TOKENS = 109013333 
OPERATIONS_TOKENS = 3150000 
BOUNTY_TOKENS = 2000000 
TEAM_TOKENS = 141820000 
PRESALE_TOKENS = 56666667 
PRIVATESALE_TOKENS = 100000000 
CROWDSALE_TOKENS = 70000000 

It should be :- 
totalSupply = 700000000 * 1 ether; 

ADVISOR_TOKENS = 7350000 * 1 ether 

STRATEGIC_PARTNERS_TOKENS = 10000000 * 1 ether 

RESERVE_TOKENS = 109013333 * 1 ether 

OPERATIONS_TOKENS = 3150000 * 1 ether 

BOUNTY_TOKENS = 2000000 * 1 ether 

TEAM_TOKENS = 141820000 * 1 ether 

PRESALE_TOKENS = 56666667 * 1 ether 

PRIVATESALE_TOKENS = 100000000 * 1 ether 

CROWDSALE_TOKENS = 70000000 * 1 ether 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
Minimum investment price is in terms of USD as provided in description, but in contract it is in terms of ether. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
2.2 Medium severity issues:-
SafeMath library is not used in every mathematical function. 
Some variables are declared but not used in program, opcodes are increased hence the gas 
Declared, unused variables: 
END_TIME_PRIVATESALE 
START_TIME_PRESALE; 
END_TIME_PRESALE; 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
You are using setHardCap() and setSoftCap() functions to change the hardcap and softcap after contract deployment which is not a good thing as you are claiming refund to investors if softcap is not reached. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
"Stage can only increment one by one and has to be changed by owner." This statement is contradicted with the smart contract, you should check current stage and then increment by one or use conditional statements. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
2.3 Low severity issues:-
Declaration of a variables and function name is not standardised at all. It is very important to use standard style define by solidity style-guide. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
There is no reserve account as you mention in your deployment steps while deploying constructor of crowdsale also start time end time parameters not present. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
Function addAddressToWhitelist must have check the current stage of a sale before whitelisting the user as stages can only be forwarded and canâ€™t be reverse, so there is no point to whitelist address who want to participate in already ended sale. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
Solidity version must be fixed.
It should not pragma solidity ^0.4.19; 
It should be pragma solidity 0.4.24;

Status : Not yet Fixed.

According to standards ,only tokens for sale should be the parts of tokenSale contract and rest of the functionality should be handled in token contract only. 
Status : Not yet Fixed.
You should use view keyword instead of constant in following functions: 
function allowance(address owner, address spender) constant public returns (uint256);

function balanceOf(address who) constant public returns (uint256);

function getStopReceive() constant public returns (bool);

Variable and function names should be meaningFul.Some of the variable names are totally meaningless. For ex: idtotokens does not make any sense.It should be like StageToTokens.If you are calculating number of tokens in every stage of sale.
3. Comments:
Constructor of crowdsale must check the argument with require statement, as it will be wastage of gas if wrong arguments is passed. 
require(_token != 0x0) should be added.
There is no conversion of ether to usd, as you mentioned conversion is dynamic.
Contract structure should be nice enough so that community can easily understand it.
Code should be properly commented.
4. Conclusion
These contracts are very unsafe to be used in production.You should review the suggested changes and implement them in smart contract.

Also please do consider proper structuring of code,naming of variables and solidity style guide. You should maintain a trade off between simplicity and performance of code.Code should be simpler to understand and at the same time performance in terms of gas utilization must be evaluated.

Note: 
This report is subject to change in future as it is only generated using manual review. Results of unit testing and automated testing are still pending.
